<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the relay server for CrewLink, an Among Us proximity voice chat program. I am currently hosting a server at `ottomated.net:9736`, but if you want a more reliable option I would suggest to deploy this repository yourself.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* yarn
```sh
npm install yarn -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ottomated/crewlink-server.git
cd crewlink-server
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
yarn install
```
3. Compile and run the project
```JS

4. Copy your server's IP and port into CrewLink settings. Make sure everyone in your lobby is using the same server.
